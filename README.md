# Chainpilot

Think of ChainPilot as the Zapier for blockchain folks - but a lot more welcoming. It’s a no-code, drag-and-drop platform that lets you connect on-chain events (like wallet transactions, NFT mints, smart contract actions) to off-chain moves (emails, Discord alerts, webhooks)—without writing a single line of code.

Here’s what you can do in seconds:
	•	📨 “When my wallet gets ETH, ping me via email.”
	•	📉 “If gas fees dip under 30 gwei, drop a note in my Discord.”
	•	🗄 “A smart contract emits an event? Log it straight to Google Sheets.”

ChainPilot supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, BTC, XRP & SOL. Perfect for builders - developers, DAOs, dApp founders—or anyone who wants to automate crypto workflows elegantly.

Why people love it:
	•	Zero-code simplicity. No need to fumble with scripts.
	•	Hybrid flexibility. One tool, both worlds.
	•	Cross-chain ready. Move freely across chains.
	•	Plug-and-play triggers. From wallets and contracts to Discord, Slack, email, and more.

If you’ve ever thought, “There’s gotta be a way to automate that blockchain thing without coding,” ChainPilot is your answer.
